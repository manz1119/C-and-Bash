# C-and-Bash

# prog4_1.sh: takes in three arguments (a password, target, and username) and retrieves remote files using scp progam

#prog4_2.c: breaks the encryption by subtracting the character we supply with the character that the encryptor gives up. 

#prog4_2.sh: compiles 4-2 c file and runs it with the encryptor

#prog4_3.c: implements the caesar cipher

#prog4_3.sh: Outputs a decrypted file for every encrypted file we stole

#prog4_4.sh: takes in four arguments (an encryptor program, prog4_2.sh, prog4_4.sh, and an encrypted file) and automates the process
